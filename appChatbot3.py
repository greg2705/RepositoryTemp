                    ‚ú® This demo is powered by [Falcon-40B](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-40b), finetuned on the [Baize](https://github.com/project-baize/baize-chatbot) dataset, and running with [Text Generation Inference](https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference). [Falcon-40B](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-40b) is a state-of-the-art large language model built by the [Technology Innovation Institute](https://www.tii.ae) in Abu Dhabi. It is trained on 1 trillion tokens (including [RefinedWeb](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tiiuae/falcon-refinedweb)) and available under the Apache 2.0 license. It currently holds the ü•á 1st place on the [ü§ó Open LLM leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard). This demo is made available by the [HuggingFace H4 team](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceH4). 
                    üß™ This is only a **first experimental preview**: the [H4 team](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceH4) intends to provide increasingly capable versions of Falcon Chat in the future, based on improved datasets and RLHF/RLAIF.
                    üëÄ **Learn more about Falcon LLM:** [falconllm.tii.ae](https://falconllm.tii.ae/)
                    ‚û°Ô∏èÔ∏è **Intended Use**: this demo is intended to showcase an early finetuning of [Falcon-40B](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-40b), to illustrate the impact (and limitations) of finetuning on a dataset of conversations and instructions. We encourage the community to further build upon the base model, and to create even better instruct/chat versions!
                    ‚ö†Ô∏è **Limitations**: the model can and will produce factually incorrect information, hallucinating facts and actions. As it has not undergone any advanced tuning/alignment, it can produce problematic outputs, especially if prompted to do so. Finally, this demo is limited to a session length of about 1,000 words.
